__This page is for version 1 of the API.  While this API still works, it has been replaced.  We highly recommend you use the [new version](http://develop.github.com/).__

The API
=======

Request will follow a common URL pattern:

    http://github.com/api/v1/:format/:username/:repository/:type/:object

* Acceptable formats: json, xml, yaml

* Acceptable types: commits, commit

Grabbing all recent commits:

    $ curl -i http://github.com/api/v1/xml/caged/gitnub/commits/master | less

Grabbing a single commit:

    $ curl -i http://github.com/api/v1/json/defunkt/github-gem/commit/c26d4ce9807ecf57d3f9eefe19ae64e75bcaaa8b | less

Repository search:

    $ curl -i http://github.com/api/v1/xml/search/merb | less

You can also grab a user's info, including a list of his repositories (Using [token authentication](http://github.com/blog/170-token-authentication) will enable listing of private repositories.):

    $ curl -i http://github.com/api/v1/json/defunkt | less

With JSON requests, you can have the result passed to a callback method of your choice:

    $ curl -i http://github.com/api/v1/json/defunkt?callback=myCallbackMethod | less
